Bossing:
- Add a way for users to export and import their character sheets
- Refactor the app to use don's layers strat, then try to merge components that apply to both presets and bossingtable (the P can be merged, but the C might not)
- Make swap buttons not have the pointer
- Account for party size
- maybe think of a superclass that character/preset inherits from
- Add character avatars to the table
- Add a reset button for all bosses -> make this happen automatically every weekly reset
- Add a clear local storage button
