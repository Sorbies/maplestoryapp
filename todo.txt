Bossing:
- Replace the boss name headers with their png icons
- Add character avatars to the table
- Add a way for users to swap the order of characters
- Add a way for users to export and import their character sheets
- Add presets
- Fix the change progess p button being delayed for some reason
    Idea: maybe the states are just being overriden by their default values when the component is mounted again. perhaps this information needs to persist in memory?
    Using persisting state did make it reload with something different from default values, but it was all in the not done state.
    since the state is shared across all instances of the component, this information might need to be passed as a prop or require arrays
