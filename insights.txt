Changing States Using Clean Copies
 - you don't want to directly modify states
 - clone the state, then modify the clone, then set the state to the clone
 - the spread operator is useful for this
 - let newstate = oldstate; //does NOT create a clean copy. it's a shallow copy

Handler functions
 - <tag onClick={handlerfunction}/> vs <tag onClick={ () => handlerfunction }/>
 - the difference between the former and the latter is that handlerfunction gets
   called first and then is assigned in the former. In the latter, handlerfunction
   gets called only on the event and never gets called immediately.

Effect Hook, CSS, Delayed Rendering
 - When I was unmounting BossingTableC and then remounting it (due to presetMode), why does the CSS not take effect until a state change?
   Also see the CSS not updating with the progress button changes
 - Trying to access the DOM in an effect hook may result in things not happening in the order you expect them.
 - Instead of checking things about the DOM, try to see if you can reprogram your code to be based on the states you used to customize the DOM.
