2023-06-22:
    - Refactored variables/functions in Bossing.js and separated them into BossingData.js and BossingCalculations.js
    - Refactored file structure of the pages

2023-06-21:
    - Got the pages configuration running
    - Added a basic nav bar
    - Organized pages into containers and presentational components
    - Made the header row for the bossing table
    - Hard coded a row for the bossing table
    - Converted the hardcoded row into multiple states in Bossing.js
    - Added ability to toggle the progress state with a button for each boss
    - Displayed boss difficulties for each boss for each character
    - Added ability to track current income earned based on what bosses are checked as cleared (with COMMAS >:D)
    - Added ability to remember states through refreshes using local storage
    - Refactored my copy-pasted hook logic that was for each state (was using a state hook and two effect hooks to init state and set up local storage).
      Now they all use the same custom hook but with diff arguments passed in (I feel like a genius)
