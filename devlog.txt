2023-06-29:
    - Added in edit mode, which hides the difficulty modes/delete column/add character sections of the table if disabled
    - Added ability to change character names inside of character mode
    - Started creating swap position buttons in edit mode

2023-06-28:
    - Refactored basically all components in the bossing app to now access the three main states using context hooks rather than props
      in order to solve prop drilling issue

2023-06-25:
    - Refactored BossingTableEditor.js and BossingTable.js in order to move the functions into more categorized files
      Thus, several new components were created for adding characters, deleting characters, changing progress, and changing difficulties.

2023-06-23:
    - Added the ability to delete characters from the bossing table (new column in the table having the button)
    - Added the ability to manipulate the difficulties of the bosses that the characters do
    - Simplified Chaos/Hard down to Hard
    - Grayed out the select difficulty buttons for the buttons that don't exist
    - Grayed out the clear button if the boss is skipped
    - Changed the non-existent difficulty buttons from being grayed out to just being hidden

2023-06-22:
    - Refactored variables/functions in Bossing.js and separated them into BossingData.js, BossingCalculations.js, and BossingTableEditor.js
    - Refactored file structure of the pages
    - Put the project up on GitHub
    - Added the ability to add characters to the bossing table
    - Removed hardcoded initial states

2023-06-21:
    - Got the pages configuration running
    - Added a basic nav bar
    - Organized pages into containers and presentational components
    - Made the header row for the bossing table
    - Hard coded a row for the bossing table
    - Converted the hardcoded row into multiple states in Bossing.js
    - Added ability to toggle the progress state with a button for each boss
    - Displayed boss difficulties for each boss for each character
    - Added ability to track current income earned based on what bosses are checked as cleared (with COMMAS >:D)
    - Added ability to remember states through refreshes using local storage
    - Refactored my copy-pasted hook logic that was for each state (was using a state hook and two effect hooks to init state and set up local storage).
      Now they all use the same custom hook but with diff arguments passed in (I feel like a genius)

2023-06-20:
    - Created this app
    - Installed React Router to add pages
    - Started adding subpages
